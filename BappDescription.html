<p>This is a simple fork of James Kettle's excellent Collaborator Everywhere, with the injection parameters changed to payloads for the critical log4j CVE-2021-44228 vulnerability. This extension only works on in-scope traffic, and works by injecting headers into your proxy traffic with log4j exploits.</p>
<p>
To avoid false positives with pingbacks such as with DNS requests made from host regex matching, and to potentially bypass filters, the ${lower:x} pattern is used in the DNS request to establish confidence that there is some kind of of jdni lookup happening - if this matches, it will set the confidence to certain.
</p>
<p>
To use it, simply install the plugin and browse the target website. Findings will be presented in the 'Issues' tab. You can easily customise injected payloads by editing /resources/injections
